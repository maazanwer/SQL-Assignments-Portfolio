This repository contains five SQL assignment sets completed during my SQL learning journey.

## Assignments Covered:

   Aggregation, grouping, filtering sales by date, employee, and department.

2. **Employee Comparisons:**  
   Subqueries, salary comparison, filtering by department logic.

3. **Pattern Matching:**  
   LIKE-based queries for first name, last name, and email filtering.

4. **Joins & Departments:**  
   INNER, LEFT, and FULL JOINs + CTE (Common Table Expression) usage for advanced grouping.

5. **Basic Selects & Updates:**  
   Filtering rows, hiring dates, department-based selections, and salary updates.
